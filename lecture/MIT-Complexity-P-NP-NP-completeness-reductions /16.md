$P=\{$ problems solvable in polynomial time $\}$

- polynomial -> $n^{O(1)}$ (for problems of size $n$)

$NP=\{$ decision problems solvable in nondeterministic polynomial time $\}$

- decision prblmes -> answer is _yes_ or _no_
- in a non-deterministic model, instead of computing, guess 1 out of polynomially many options in constant time $O(1)$
- if any guess would lead to _yes_ answer then we get such a guess

**NP-hard**

- $X$ is NP-hard if every problem $y\in NP$ can be Karp-reduced to $X$
- As a consequence, finding a polynomial time algorithm to solve a single NP-hard problem would give polynomial time algorithms for all the problems in the complexity class NP. As it is suspected that Pâ‰ NP, it is unlikely that such an algorithm exists
- "at least as hard as every problem in NP"

**NP-complete**

- $X$ is NP-complete if $X\in$ NP and $X$ is NP-hard
- Example: **Boolean satisfiability**

**Complexities difficulty:**

- NOTE: we don't know whether $P=NP$. (probably not according MIT guy)
- assuming $P\neq NP$, any NP-hard problem is not in P.

**Reduction** from problem $A \to B$ = poly-time algorithm converting $A$ inputs $\to$ _equivalent_ $B$ inputs

- _Equivalent_ means they have the same yes/no answer
- If $B\in P$ then $A\in P$
- If $B\in NP$ then $A\in NP$

**How to prove $X$ is NP-complete:**

1. Prove that $X\in NP$
   - nondeterministic algorithm OR certificate + verifier
   - The term **certicate** does not have a formal meaning, but it is some information that we use for proving that some instance of a problem is a yes instance.
2. prove that $X\in NP$-hard
   - Reduce from known NP-complete problem $Y$ to $X$

- **CoNP** consists of all problems where "no" answer can be efficiently verified
  - we say $x\in CoNP$ if the complement $\overline{X}\in NP$
  - **CoNP-hard** (as hard as all problems in CoNP)
  - **CoNP-complete** (the hardest problems in CoNP)
  - $X$ is CoNP-hard (or CoNO-complete) $\Leftrightarrow$ $\overline X$ is NP-Hard (or NP-complete)
  - This means that for every NP-complete problem there is acorresponding CoNP-complete problem (and vice versa)
- **PSPACE** consists of all problems that can be solved by an algorithm using at most a polynomial amount of space.
  - $P\subseteq PSPACE$
  - $NP\subseteq PSPACE$
  - $PSPACE$-hard if $X \leq _p Y$ for every $X\in PSPACE$
  - $PSPACE$-complete if $PSPACE$-hard and additionally $Y\in PSPACE$
- **BPP** (Bounded-error Probabilistic Polynomial-time) consists of all decision problems for which there is a polynomial-time randomized algorithms that is correct with probability at least 2/3 on all instances.
- **ZPP** (Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial Time) consists of all decision problems for which there is a Las Vegas algorithm running in expected polynomial time.
